# Backends
AirScript currently comes bundled with two backends:

- [Winterfell backend](https://github.com/0xMiden/air-script/tree/main/codegen/winterfell) which outputs `Air` trait implementation for the [Winterfell prover](https://github.com/facebook/winterfell) (Rust).
- [ACE backend](https://github.com/0xMiden/air-script/tree/main/codegen/ace) which outputs arithmetic circuits for Miden VM's ACE (Arithmetic Circuit Evaluation) chiplet for recursive STARK proof verification.

These backends can be used programmatically as crates. 

The Winterfell backend can also be used via AirScript CLI by specifying `--target` flag. For example, the following will output Winterfell `Air` trait implementation for AIR constraints described in `example.air` file:
```
./target/release/airc transpile examples/example.air --target winterfell
```
In both cases we assumed that the CLI has been compiled as described [here](./introduction.md#cli).
