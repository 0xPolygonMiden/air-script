/// This pass performs the following transformations on a [Program]:
///
/// * Monomorphizing and inlining evaluators/functions at their call sites
/// * Unrolling constraint comprehensions into a sequence of scalar constraints
/// * Unrolling list comprehensions into a tree of `let` statements which end in a vector expression
///   (the implicit result of the tree). Each iteration of the unrolled comprehension is reified as
///   a value and bound to a variable so that other transformations may refer to it directly.
/// * Rewriting aliases of top-level declarations to refer to those declarations directly
/// * Removing let-bound variables which are unused, which is also used to clean up after the
///   aliasing rewrite mentioned above.
///
/// The trickiest transformation comes with inlining the body of evaluators at their
/// call sites, as evaluator parameter lists can arbitrarily destructure/regroup columns
/// provided as arguments for each trace segment. This means that columns can be passed
/// in a variety of configurations as arguments, and the patterns expressed in the evaluator
/// parameter list can arbitrarily reconfigure them for use in the evaluator body.
///
/// For example, let's say you call an evaluator `foo` with three columns, passed as individual
/// bindings, like so: `foo([a, b, c])`. Let's further assume that the evaluator signature
/// is defined as `ev foo([x[2], y])`. While you might expect that this would be an error,
/// and that the caller would need to provide the columns in the same configuration, that
/// is not the case. Instead, `a` and `b` are implicitly re-bound as a vector of trace column
/// bindings for use in the function body. There is further no requirement that `a` and `b`
/// are consecutive bindings either, as long as they are from the same trace segment. During
/// compilation however, accesses to individual elements of the vector will be rewritten to use
/// the correct binding in the caller after inlining, e.g. an access like `x[1]` becomes `b`.
///
/// This pass accomplishes three goals:
///
/// * Remove all function abstractions from the program
/// * Remove all comprehensions from the program
/// * Inline all constraints into the integrity and boundary constraints sections
/// * Make all references to top-level declarations concrete
///
/// When done, it should be impossible for there to be any invalid trace column references.
///
/// It is expected that the provided [Program] has already been run through semantic analysis
/// and constant propagation, so a number of assumptions are made with regard to what syntax can
/// be observed at this stage of compilation (e.g. no references to constant declarations, no
/// undefined variables, expressions are well-typed, etc.).
