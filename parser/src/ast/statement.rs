//! This module provides AST structures for statements which may appear in one of the following:
//!
//! * Evaluator function bodies
//! * The `boundary_constraints` section
//! * The `integrity_constraints` section
//!
//! Statements do not return any value, unlike expressions.

    /// A let statement contains all following statements in its containing block as
    /// the "body" of the let. In other words, it imposes a new lexical scope within the
    /// block in which the variable it binds is visible. Because of this, a let statement
    /// will always be the last statement in a block when one is present.
    ///
    /// Furthermore, the parser guarantees that a let statement always has a body, which
    /// by induction guarantees that a let statement will always have a constraint in its body
    /// at some point, otherwise parsing would fail. This guarantee holds during all analyses
    /// and transformations.
    Let(Let),
    /// Represents a value expression in the tail position of a block
    ///
    /// This is only used in pure function contexts, and during certain transformations. It
    /// is not valid in any position but the last statement of a block, and that block must
    /// be in an expression context (i.e. pure function body, let-bound expression that expands
    /// during inlining to a block of statements that are used to build up a value).
    Expr(Expr),
    /// Declares a constraint to be enforced on a single value.
    ///
    /// This variant accepts a [ScalarExpr] for simplicity in the parser, but is expected to always
    /// be either a call to an evaluator function, or a binary expression of the form `lhs = rhs`,
    /// i.e. an equality. This is validated by the semantic analyzer.

    /// Declares a constraint to be conditionally enforced.
    ///
    /// This has all the same semantics as `Enforce`, except it has a condition expression which
    /// determines if the constraint will be enforced.
    ///
    /// This variant is only present in the AST after inlining is performed, even though the parser
    /// could produce it directly from the parse tree. This is because this variant is equivalent to
    /// a comprehension constraint with a single element, so we transform all syntax corresponding to
    /// `EnforceIf` into `EnforceAll` form so we can reuse all of the analyses/optimizations/transformations
    /// for both. However, when lowering to the IR, we perform inlining/unrolling of comprehensions, and
    /// at that time we need `EnforceIf` in order to represent unrolled constraints which have a selector
    /// that is only resolvable at runtime.
    EnforceIf(#[span] ScalarExpr, ScalarExpr),
    /// Declares a constraint to be enforced over a vector of values produced by a comprehension.

    /// and must be enforced on every value produced by that comprehension.
